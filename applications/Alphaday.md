**Project Description**

Details:
Stage of your project (just an idea, already in progress, proof of concept or prototype): Beta Version is Live at https://app.alphaday.com/.

An overview of the technology stack to be used: Alphaday is a React-Typescript dashboard on the frontend using a Python-Django backend built on distributed infrastructure with Postgres and Redis Databases.

What your project is not or will not provide or implement: We are a data aggregator, and unique in what we are trying to provide the market.

What we are building will simplify things for the end users, and our product augments and further propagates the work of data creators.

**Ecosystem Fit/Impact**

Details:
Crypto has exploded in popularity over the last 4-5 years and there is so much going on that it’s almost impossible to keep up with everything. Our user research showed that users are overwhelmed with information and spend a lot of time jumping from one news source to another, from one social site to another, and usually have dozens of tabs open to stay up to date with everything happening in a community. 

Having all this information in one place allows Function X Network stakeholders (i.e. users, developers, investors) to easily stay up to date on Function X Network ecosystem updates, see the latest news and developments, do research and stay engaged. In general users who can track their favourite projects more easily stay more engaged with the project which in turn supports user retention. 

We’ve done market research on this and currently people’s regular crypto workflows consist of jumping from one browser tab to another to check prices, read news, follow twitter, participate in discussions . A typical crypto user will have 6 to 10 open tabs at any given time and people have referred to Alphaday as the ‘tab killer’ because all the information you’d need across all your different tabs is available in Alphaday. In this sense, we do not have any direct competitor that can provide 50 different types of services and functionality within one dashboard.

Are there any other projects similar to yours in other EVM/Cosmos ecosystem?

We will also publish the initial deployment of the new Function X Network dashboard on all social media platforms.

Associated costs

1,200 USDC upfront costs for development including integrating the discussion forums, blog post, social feed, jobs listing, TVL and other on-chain metrics.

100 USDC per month for 12 months for maintenance including having an Alphaday content analyst quality-checking the dashboard every day and ensuring the Calendar widget is up-to-date with latest Function X Network events, all news mentions across the internet are captured by the dashboard, any updates not automatically captured by the Alphaday aggregator engine is manually added to the board, and other maintenance tasks.

There are no additional costs required for the development and deployment of the dashboard. Furthermore, no foreseeable additional risks to Function X Network are associated with the creation of the Alphaday Dashboard.

Future plans:

We will continue this process of iterating, deploying, and collecting feedback continuously to build a dashboard that Function X stakeholders truly love to use.

We are in the process of applying for grants to further develop our app and dashboard. Some projects (such as Aave, Dfinity, Zcash, and others) have already approved to fund us and we are currently in the process of building their dashboards.
