### **Overview**

**Project Name:** VeSwap

**Summary of your project and how it would help our 
ecosystem:** VeSwap is a next generation of AMM/DEX inspired from uniswap and curve, it will provide users on FunctionX an efficient and cost-effective 
way to trade assets. VeSwap is designed to be fully decentralised from day one, thus giving the governance and power
to the community.

**The level of amount you are requesting for?**
Level 3, $30000

Distribution schematic:

1. Post completion of [Development Phase](/applications/inquiry_proposal_applicants/ve-swap.md#q3---q4-2022-development-phase) => $15000

The funds will be used to bootstrap initial liquidity for ($VESW/$FX or $VESW/$USDC) pair and cover initial protocol expenses.

2. Post completion of [Launch Phase](/applications/inquiry_proposal_applicants/ve-swap.md#q1-2023-launch-phase) => $10000

The funds will be used for future protocol development and cover protocol/marketing expenses. 

3. Post completion of [Growth Phase](/applications/inquiry_proposal_applicants/ve-swap.md#q1-q2-2023-growthmarketing-phase) => $5000

**Category your project belongs to:** 
DeFi

### **Project Description**

VeSwap Is an Automated market maker building on FunctionX chain. VeSwap brings significant 
improvements compared to the current decentralised-exchanges(majorily uniswap forks) with the following features.

1. Supports Stable Swaps and Uniswap Style volatile swaps with very Low Slippage.
2. Dex with minimal Fees of just 0.15 percent, some of the lowest in defi.
3. Support uniswap style LP and curve-inspired Gauges for a better and decentralized liquidity incentivization.
4. Allows permissionless access to create bribes on any LP pools
5. Fully Decentralised from day one, with ve tokenomics. ve Holders control the protocol, revenue, and token emissions.

### **Team profile**

The veSwap team comes from diverse background and has significant experience of building and operating
defi protocols. Current team consists of four core team members, three developers and one designer.

The team previously launched Oracle Finance, a yield generating, deflationary multi-utility protocol on polygon network. 
Oracle Finance raised around 100k in presale, and after a few months of operation became a part of mdb gravity (https://www.mdb.fund/)

Previous Works: https://github.com/Oracle-DAO

The team is pseudo-anonymous but is willing to share more information/KYC details with FunctionX
team.

### **Ecosystem Fit/Impact**

#### **Problems with current decentralised Exchanges.**

**Multi Swap Curve Support:**
Most exchange allow only one type of swap curve, either low slippage stable swap or uniswap style swaps.

**Liquidity Incentivization:**
Every DEX needs to maintain a healthy liquidity to provide seamless and low slippage swaps to the users.
Providing emissions (in project token) is one of the most preferred way, but it can be costly to maintain,
and often times result in a "farm and dump" resulting in "unsticky" liquidity.

**Centralised Control of Token Emission:**
Most DEX allocate tokens to LP pools in a centralized manner, rewarding their own LPs and partner protocols,
leading to sub-optimal allocation of emissions.

#### **Why veSwap ?**
VeSwap Supports Stable Swaps and Uniswap Style volatile swaps, with just 0.15% fees. VeSwap also comes with curve 
inspired gauges, and a bribe market for a better liquidity incentivization.
