## ***Ecosystem Fit/Impact***
 
**What problem are you solving:**

Our goal is to provide some serious upgrade to function-x blockchain with a mass adoption use case!
Every chain needs its own NFT marketplace, so here is our! FoxChange where people can sell Function X NFT & more! 

**Who will benefit:**

The entire FunctionX ecosystem. The most important usecase is the fee`s people have to pay in FX when they make any transaction on our marketplace or move the coins/NFTs .NFT´S attract a lot of people and investors.
Are there any other similar projects in the FunctionX ecosystem: As it stands, there are currently no other projects like FoxGaming.
